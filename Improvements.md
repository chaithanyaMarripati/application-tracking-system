## IMPROVEMENTS

When our team took over the project from the previous group, we thoroughly reviewed the project in order to establish an effective takeover strategy. We attempted to improve the project in as many ways as possible. We've detailed the enhancements we've made in this document.

* Easier setup instructions and Installation process:
The previous instructions were cumbersome and unnecessarily manual. We had dockerized the application such that it allows to standerdise the development and release cycle. We also hosted mongodb to skip all the local installation.
